# Changelog

## 1.2.0 - 2026-01-05
- DB schema update for action meta handling (migration required before deploying this version).
- Unified SupplierRefsInlinePanel in purchase/suppliers (removed duplicate in stock/, adjusted imports).
- Renamed and cleaned StockItemSearch (formerly StockItemLinkForm) with convention-compliant split components.
- Removed unused/duplicate supplier reference components to reduce dead code.

### Upgrade notes

2. Deploy the new front-end build after migrations.
3. Recommended checks: `npm run lint` and `npm run build`.
